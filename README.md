# PyTorch-Linear-GAN
A PyTorch notebook and implementation of a normal linear GAN

This repository contains a ready to use vanilla GAN accessible through the terminal as well as a jupyter notebook with the exact same network structure for easier overview. The notebook is also optimized for training in Google Collaboratory.
GANs were [first introduced](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) in 2014 from Ian Goodfellow and others. 
GANs consists of two networks: a generator ***G*** and a discriminator ***D***. The generator is designed to generate realistic looking data "fake data" and the discriminator is designed to distinguish between generated "fake data" and real data from a dataset. Both networks play a game against each other where the generator tries to fool the discriminator by generating data as real as possible and the discriminator tries to classify fake and real data correctly.

* The generator is a linear feedforward network which takes a random vector as input and outputs another vector which can be reshaped to an image
* The discriminator is a linear classifier that takes an image vector as input and outputs a probability of that image being real.

This game leads to a generator producing data that is indistinguishable from real data to the discriminator
